# XECT-Crypt
My first program with a complex(ish) GUI. Its pretty self explanatory but it takes a file in, encrypt it with a randomaly generated key (this key is 32-384 bytes depending on the setting you choose). The key file (key.txt) is saved along with the new encrypted file. This can then later be decrypted by using the same file and matching key (the name of the original file is written to the key file btw). When a file is selected the select button turns green, the clear button clears all previous inputs. Enjoy
